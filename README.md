# 📝 Text Editor with Undo/Redo (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **simple text editor simulation** built in Python.  
It allows users to:
- Add changes to a document  
- Undo the last change  
- Redo an undone change  
- Display the current document state  

It demonstrates the use of **stacks (LIFO)** to implement **Undo** and **Redo** functionality.
